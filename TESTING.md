# KinderDag - Testing Guide

## Testing the App on Your Mobile Device

### Option 1: Using Expo Go (Recommended for Quick Testing)

1. **Install Expo Go** on your mobile device:
   - iOS: Download from the App Store
   - Android: Download from Google Play Store

2. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Scan the QR Code**:
   - iOS: Use your Camera app to scan the QR code displayed in the terminal
   - Android: Use the Expo Go app to scan the QR code

4. **Wait for the app to load** on your device (first load may take 30-60 seconds)

**Important Note:** If you see "This screen doesn't exist" error:
- This was a routing issue that has been fixed
- Close Expo Go completely and restart it
- Clear Metro cache: `npx expo start -c`
- Scan the QR code again

See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for more help.

### Option 2: Using a Development Build

For a more native experience with full functionality:
